  |   Feel like a real Pokémon Trainer as you travel through the Kanto      |
  |   region in the Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let's Go,       |
  |   Eevee! games with Poké Ball Plus. The power of a Pokémon Trainer      |
  |   lies in the palm of your hand.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Become the best Pokémon Trainer as you battle other Trainers, Gym     |
  |   Leaders, and the sinister Team Rocket. Catch Pokémon in the wild      |
  |   using a gentle throwing motion with either a Joy-Con controller or    |
  |   a Poké Ball Plus accessory, which will light up, vibrate, and make    |
  |   sounds to bring your adventure to life. You can also use button       |
  |   controls in Handheld Mode. Share your adventure with family or        |
  |   friends using a second Joy-Con or Poké Ball Plus (sold                |
  |   separately). You can even connect to the Pokémon GO app using a       |
  |   compatible smartphone to bring over Pokémon originally discovered     |
  |   in the Kanto region!                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore the vibrant region of Kanto-home to beloved characters like   |
  |   Brock, Misty, and the nefarious trio Jessie, James, and Meowth!       |
  |   Throughout the story, your bond with your partner Pokémon grows       |
  |   stronger as you care for it and travel together. See the world in     |
  |   style by customizing Pikachu and your Trainer with a selection of     |
  |   outfits. True-to-size wild Pokémon roam around in the game-catch      |
  |   them like a real Pokémon Trainer by using timing and a well-placed    |
  |   Poké Ball. Battle and trade with other players who own the game       |
  |   via local wireless or online. Go on a stroll with your favorite       |
  |   Pokémon in your Poké Ball Plus to level them up, and to receive       |
  |   in-game rewards after returning them to the game. Connect to          |
  |   Pokémon GO to transfer caught Kanto-region Pokémon, including         |
  |   Alolan and Shiny forms, as well as the newly discovered Pokémon,      |

  |    - The issue where the Pokémon received through Mystery Gift does     |
  |    not get registered in the Pokédex when exiting the game without      |
  |    saving has been resolved.                                            |

  |    - If you have already received the Pokémon through Mystery Gift,     |
  |    put the Pokémon that is not registered in the Pokédex in the         |
  |    Pokémon Box and download the update data. Once this is done,         |
  |    the Pokémon should be reflected in the Pokédex.                      |
